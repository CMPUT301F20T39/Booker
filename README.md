# Booker
Booker is an Edmonton-based book sharing platform for Android. It allows owners to record the books they have and loan them to borrowers. A user can be both an owner of their own books and a borrower of someone else's books. A borrower can borrow an available book by making a request for it. The owner can accept such a request. When the book is handed over, the book becomes borrowed. The owner can denote when a borrowed book is returned and available again.
